  version: 0.9.3-wip
  description: |
    Edge Application Management API allows API consumers to manage the
    Life Cycle of an Application and to Discover Edge Cloud Zones.
    # Overview
    The reference scenario foresees a distributed Telco Edge Cloud where any
    Application Delevoper, known as an Application Provider, can host and
    deploy their application according to their specifications and operational
    criteria (e.g. within an specific geographical zone for data protection
    purposes, ensure a minimum QoS for the application clients, etc).
    Through Telco Edge Cloud services Developers around the globe can be
    benefit from the traditional Cloud strengths but expertise and advantages
    of the Mobile Network Operators offering to their users an evolved
    experience for XR, V2X, Holographic and other new services.

    # Introduction
    The Edge Application Management API provides capabilities for lifecycle
    management of application, instances and edge cloud zone discovery.
    Lifecycle Management allows Application Provider to onboard
    their application to the Edge Cloud Platform which do bookkeeping,
    resource validation and other pre-deployment operations.
    Application details can contain components network specification,
    package type (QCOW2, OVA, CONTAINER, HELM), operating system details and
    respository to download the image of the desired application.
    Once the application is available on the Edge Cloud
    Platform, the Application Provider can instantiate the application.
    Edge Cloud Provider helps Application Provider to decide where to
    instantiate the applications allowing them to retrieve a list of
    Edge Cloud Zones that meets the provided criteria.

    This discovery can be filtered by an specific geographical region
    (e.g when data residency is need) and by status (active, inactive, unknown)
    Application Provider can ask the Edge Cloud Platform to instantiate the
    application to one or several Edge Cloud Zones that meet the criteria.
    Typically when more than one Edge Cloud Zone is required in the same
    geographic boundary, Application Provider can define instead
    the entire Edge Cloud Region.

    Application Provider can retrieve the information of the instances
    for a given application, the information could be the Edge Cloud Zone
    where the instance is, status (ready, instantiating, failed,
    terminating, unknown) and endpoint (ip, port, fqdn).
    Application Provider can terminate an instance of an application
    (appInstanceId) or all the instances for a given appId.

    # Quick Start
    The usage of this API is based on several resources including GSMA
    Edge Platform, Public Cloud and SDOs, to define a first approach on the
    lifecycle management of application instances and edge cloud zones discovery

    Before starting to use the API, the developer needs to know about
    the below specified details.

    __Application Management__
    * __submitApp__ - Submits application details to an Edge Cloud Provider.
    Based on the details provided, Edge Cloud Provider shall do bookkeeping,
    resource validation and other pre-deployment operations.
    * __deleteApp__ - Removes an application from an Edge Cloud Provider,
    if there is a running instance of the given application,
    the request cannot be done.
    * __getApp__ - Retrieves the information of a given application.

    __Application Instance Management__
    * __createAppInstance__  Request the Edge Cloud Provider to instatiate
    an instance of an application in a given Edge Cloud Zone,
    if this parameter is not set, the Edge Cloud Provider will instantiate
    the applications in all the Edge Cloud Zones.
    * __getAppInstance__  Retrieves the list with information of the instances
    related to a given application.
    * __deleteAppInstance__ - Removes a given application instance from an Edge
    Cloud Zone.

    __Edge Cloud information__
    *  __getEdgeCloudZones__ List of the operators Edge Cloud Zones and their
    status, ordering the results by location and filtering by status
    (active/inactive/unknown)

    # Authentication and Authorization
    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API
    clients access to the API functionality, as outlined in the document
    [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject\
    /IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access\
    -and-user-consent.md).
    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during
    onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Edge
    exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the
    API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by
    local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is
    processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms
    such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes
    mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance
    with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the
    principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
    # API documentation
    Two operations have been defined in Edge Application Management API.

    *__Application__* - The Application Provider submit application metadata to
    the Edge Cloud Platform. The Edge Cloud Platform generates an appId for that
    metadata that will be used to instantiate the application within
    the Edge Cloud Zone.

    *__Edge Cloud__* - Retrieves all the Edge Cloud Zones available according to
    some defined parameters where an application can be instantiated.

    Definitions of terminologies commonly referred
    to throughout the API descriptions.
    * __Application Provider__ - The provider of the application that accesses
    an Edge Cloud Provider to deploy its application on the Edge Cloud.
    An Application Provider may be part of a larger organisation,
    like an enterprise, enterprise customer of an Edge Cloud Provider,
    or be an independent entity.
    * __Application__ - Contains the information about the application to be
    instantiated. Descriptor, binary image, charts or any other package
    assosiated with the application. The Application Provider request contains
    mandatory criteria (e.g. required CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth) defined
    in an Application. The Edge Cloud Platform generates a unique ID
    for an Application that is ready to be instantiated.
    * __Application Instance__ - Is an instance (VM or Container based) running
    in an Edge Cloud Zone. The Edge Cloud Platform generates a unique ID
    for each instance.
    * __Edge Cloud__ - Cloud-like capabilities located at the network edge
    including, from the Application Provider's perspective, access to
    elastically allocated compute, data storage and network resources,
    this access is provided through the Edge Cloud Platform.
    * __Edge Cloud Provider__ - Company name of the provider offering the
    Edge Services through the Edge Cloud Platform.
    Could be an Operator or a Cloud Provider.
    * __Edge Cloud Region__ - An Edge Cloud Region is equivalent
    to a Region on a Public Cloud.
    The higher construct in the hierarchy exposed to an Application
    Provider who wishes to deploy an Application on the Edge Cloud and broadly
    represents a geography. An Edge CloudRegion typically contains one or
    multiple Edge Cloud Zones.
    An Edge Cloud Region exists within an Edge Cloud.
    * __Edge Cloud Zone__ - An Edge Cloud Zone is the lowest level of
    abstraction exposed to an Application Provider who wants to deploy
    an Application on Edge Cloud.
    Edge Cloud Zones exists within a Edge Cloud Region.
