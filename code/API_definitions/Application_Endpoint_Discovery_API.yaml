    # Connect to the Nearest Application Endpoint
    ---
    # Overview
    The Application Discovery API extends beyond the capabilities of the
    Simple Edge Discovery API by not only locating the nearest Edge Cloud Zone
    but also directly linking to the application endpoints within those zones.
    This crucial enhancement enables immediate connection to the most relevant
    service endpoint, optimizing the application's interaction with
    edge computing resources.
    # Introduction
    Operators often host multiple Edge Cloud Zones across various territories.
    Connecting an application directly to the nearest operational service
    endpoint minimizes latency because data travels the shortest possible route.
    Unlike the Simple Edge Discovery API, which only provides the zone location,
    this API calculates and provides the actual endpoints within the nearest
    zone. This approach ensures that developers can instantly integrate these
    endpoints into their applications, improving performance and user
    experience.
    After identifying the nearest application endpoint through the API,
    developers can:
    * Connect their application client directly to the chosen application
    endpoint, enhancing the responsiveness and reliability of the service.
    * Deploy new instances if no suitable endpoints are within the identified
    Edge Cloud Zone, optimizing their service distribution based on real-time
    network geography.
    # Quick Start
    This API can be utilized by both client applications on user devices and
    by servers. It uses a straightforward endpoint:
    `/apps-endpoints?filter=closest`.
    API consumers are required to authenticate via OAuth2 to obtain access
    tokens,
    which must be included in the `Authorization` header of API requests.
    For accurate service localization, the API requires device-specific
    identifiers such as:
    * `IP-Address`: Public IP address of the user device, which can be fetched
    via
    external IP discovery services.
    * `Phone-Number` : The device's phone number in international E.164 format.
    * `Network-Access-Identifier`: A unique identifier provided by the network
    operator.
    If the API is accessed directly from a device within the operator's network,
    initial requests may be made without explicit device identifiers. However,
    if this results in a `404 Not Found` error, subsequent requests should
    include
    one of the identifiers to ensure accurate localization of the nearest
    endpoint.
    ## Example request
    The following examples demonstrate how to make requests to the Application
    Discovery API, which provides direct access to the nearest application
    endpoint
    within the nearest Edge Cloud Zone based on the user's device identifiers.
    Example 1: Request with Network-Access-Identifier
    ```
    GET /apps-endpoints?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
    Accept: application/json
    Network-Access-Identifier: 4d596ac1-7822-4927-a3c5-d72e1f922c94@domain.com
    ```
    Example 2: Request with IP-Address
    ```
      GET /apps-endpoints?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
      Accept: application/json
      IP-Address: 84.125.93.10
    ```
    Example 3: Request with Phone-Number
    ```
      GET /apps-endpoints?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
      Accept: application/json
      Phone-Number: +441234567890
    ```
    # Authorization and authentication
    In order to maintain the integrity and security of the Application Discovery
    API, access is governed by robust authentication and authorization
    processes.
    This ensures that only valid, authorized requests are able to interact with
    the API and retrieve application endpoint information.
    ## OpenID Connect
    The API utilizes OpenID Connect on top of OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
    Users must register to obtain client credentials, which are necessary to
    acquire access tokens from the OpenID provider.
    ## Obtaining Access Tokens
    Access tokens are obtained by submitting a request to the designated OpenID
    Connect URL, utilizing the client credentials. It is imperative that the
    retrieved token is included in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer`
    token for all subsequent API requests.
    ## Scopes and Permissions
    During the token request, developers will need to specify the scopes that
    correspond to the permissions the application requires. Our API strictly
    enforces scope validation to ensure clients only perform operations that
    are within their granted permissions.
    ## Secure Transmission
    All communication with the API, including token requests, must occur over
    HTTPS to ensure data confidentiality and protection.
    ## Error Handling
    If a request is made without a token or with an expired or invalid token,
    the API will return a  `401 Unauthorized` status code. Similarly, if the
    token does not include the proper scopes for the requested operation,
    a `403 Forbidden` status code will be returned, indicating
    insufficient permissions.
