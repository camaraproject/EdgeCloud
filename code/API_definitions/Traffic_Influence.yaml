    ## Overview
    The reference scenario foresees a Service, composed by one or more Service
    Producers deployed in different geographical locations on Edge Cloud Zones
    (Edge datacentres of Telco Operator) or in Cloud. The Service Producer,
    deployed at the Edge, is referred as Edge Application Server (EAS).\
    An Edge Cloud Zone is a platform in the Telco Operator network, offering
    network, compute and storage resources to developers. A developer can
    deploy and run applications on an Edge Cloud Zone, meaning reduced latency
    to end users that are nearby, as the network path is shorter. A network
    operator's EdgeCloud may comprise multiple Edge Cloud Zones, each in a
    discrete location to bring latency benefits to end users across a country.\
    The operator can help developers know which of the Edge Cloud Zones will
    bring the best performance benefit for a given end user and application\.
    The Traffic Influence API (TI API) provides the fastest routing from the
    user Device (e.g. a Smartphone) to the optimal EAS instance in a specific
    geographical location, installed in an Edge Cloud Zone.\
    If a Service is offered by Cloud Instances and by Edge Instances, the TI API
    can be used get the optimal routing of the traffic to the Edge Instances,
    maybe for a set of users. Getting the optimal routing can be used to improve
    latency maybe in combination with other CAMARA APIs such as QoD (Quality On
    Demand). Providing the optimal routing is indeed an important step to get
    the optimal latency.\
    If the TI API is used to get the best routing at the Edge for a Device in a
    geographical location and the Device moves to another geographical location,
    the TI API can be invoked to get the optimal routing in the new geographical
    location for that Device.
    ## Introduction
    The TI API provides the capability to establish the best routing, in terms
    of latency, in a specific geographical area, between the user Device, e.g.
    the user’s smartphone, and the optimal EAS instance nearby. If the Device
    moves in a different geographical location where a more suitable EAS
    instance is available, the TI API can be invoked to influence the Device
    connectivity to get the optimal routing to the that local instance. It is i
    mportant to notice that it is a task of the Application invoking the TI API
    to detect the changes in the Device location.\
    The generic architecture for the Service can foresee some Cloud instances of
    the Application, one or more Edge Instances of the Application. A component
    of the Service is the TI API Consumer. This logical component can be
    integrated in other components of the Service to invoke the TI API, creating
    a "TrafficInfluence" resource specifying the desired intent.\
    The TI API Producer implements the intent specified in the
    "TrafficInfluence" resource.\
    While the TI API can be invoked to activate the fastest routing for any
    user, it can also be used to request the best routing for a specific user.
    Invoking the TI API for each user, many "TrafficInfluence" resources are
    created for each user to provide the requested routing for a set of users.\
    The same approach is used for the geographical locations where the influence
    of the traffic must be applied. Invoking the TI API without specifying a
    geographical area activates the optimal routing toward any EAS instance,
    while invoking the TI API specifying a geographical area activates the
    optimal routing only toward the EAS instance located closest to that
    geographical area.\
    To activate the optimal routing in selected geographical areas, the TI API
    must be invoked for each geographical area.\
    The TI API can be used to:
    - optimise the routing when Devices need to consume the service provided
        by a local EAS Instances.
    - affect an already established Device routing when the Device moves
        among different geographical locations. When the TI API consumer detects
        a Device has entered a geographical location where an EAS instance is
        available, it can invoke the TI API to get the optimal routing toward
        that EAS instance.
        If the Device moves to another geographical location, served by another
        EAS instance, the routing might not be optimal anymore for the new EAS
        instance. In the case the Application detects a location change, it can
        invoke the TI API again to request a new routing optimization toward
        the new EAS instance.
    ## Quick Start
    The usage of the TI API is based on the management of a "TrafficInfluence"
    resource, an object containing the intent requested invoking the TI API and
    that is implemented by the platform configuring the Mobile Network for the
    optimal routing toward the EAS instance.\
    The "TrafficInfluence" resource can be created (providing the related
    parameters that specify the desired intent), queried, modified and
    deleted.\
    The TI API is asynchronous, a notification is available providing
    information about the status of the requested resource.
    For an Application (identified by "appId") many "TrafficInfluence" resources
    can be created, e.g. to add multiple users, regions or zones.\
    \
    Before starting to use the TI API, the developer needs to know about the
    below specified details:\
    \
    **Base-Url**
    The RESTful TI API endpoint, for example
    [**https://tim-api.developer.tim.it/trafficinfluence**](https://tim-api.\
    developer.tim.it/trafficinfluence)\
    \
    **TrafficInfluence**
    This object represents the resource that carries the requirements from the
    user to be implemented. The TI API is invoked for the life cycle management
    of this resource (CRUD). The resource contains the intents from the TI API
    Consumer. Managing this resource, the developer can specify in which
    geographical location the routing must be applied, toward which application,
    maybe for a specific set of users or for a limited period of time.\
    \
    **trafficInfluenceID**
    Identifier for the Traffic Influence resource. This parameter is returned
    by the TI API and must be used to update it (e.g., adding a Device or
    deleting it). A different Traffic Influence resource must be created for
    any Device or Zone or Region. All these resources are related to an
    Application identified by "appId".\
    \
    **apiConsumerId**
    Unique identifier for the TI API Consumer.\
    \
    **region**
    The developer can specify in which geographical area he requires the fastest
    routing toward the nearest application instance. A "region" is a wide
    geographical area and it contains one or more "zones". A "zone" is where the
    Edge Cloud Zone is located. Zones and Regions identifiers are defined and
    provided by the Telco Operator and can also be used or retrieved with other
    CAMARA APIs (“MEC Exposure & Experience Management API” and “Simple Edge
    Discovery”). To add more regions the TI API must be invoked (POST) for each
    region. New "TrafficInfluence" resources are created (with different
    "trafficInfluenceID"). All the created resources are aggregated by the
    Application (identified by "appId").\
    \
    **zone**
    The developer can specify in which geographical area he requires the fastest
    routing toward the nearest Application instance. A "zone" is a smaller
    geographical area inside a "region". A "zone" is where the Edge Cloud Zone
    is located.\
    To add more zones the TI API must be invoked (POST) for each "zone".
    New "TrafficInfluence" resources are created (with different
    "trafficInfluenceID"). All the created resources are aggregated by the
    Application (identified by "appId").\
    \
    **appId**
    A globally unique identifier associated with the application. This
    identifier is provided during the application onboarding process.
    To influence the traffic toward a specific Application. It is the Operator
    Platform that detects the appropriate Application instance in the selected
    "region" or "zone".\
    \
    **appInstanceId**
    A globally unique identifier generated by the Operator Platform to identify
    a specific instance of the Application on a specific zone. To influence a
    traffic toward a specific Application instance.\
    \
    **trafficFilters**
    The Application can expose different service on different interfaces, with
    this parameter it is possible to enable just some of those services maybe
    for different sets of users.\
    \
    **Device**
    A user Device can be provided as an input. To add more users the TI API must
    be invoked (POST) of each user Device. New "TrafficInfluence" resources are
    created (with different "trafficInfluenceID"). All the created resources are
    aggregated by the Application (identified by "appId"). The routing toward
    the selected Application instance is only applied for provided user
    Devices.\
    \
    **Notification URL and token**
    Developers have a chance to specify call back URL on which notifications
    (e.g. session termination) regarding the session can be received from the
    service provider. This is also an optional parameter.
    ## Authentication and Authorization
    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API
    clients access to the API functionality, as outlined in the document
    [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject\
    /IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access\
    -and-user-consent.md).
    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during
    onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator
    exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the
    API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by
    local legislation.\
    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is
    processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms
    such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes
    mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance
    with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the
    principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
    ## API Documentation
    The TI API is consumed by an Application Function (AF) requesting for the
    optimal routing, in term of latency, for the traffic flow from a Device
    toward EAS instances in Edge Cloud Zones.\
    When the Application (the EAS) is onboarded and deployed in the Edge Cloud
    Zones, the Application is identified with a unique identifier ("appId").\
    Using the application identifier ("appId") and specifying a Zone or a Region
    the Telco Operator Platform, autonomously identifies the best instance of
    the EAS toward which routing the traffic flow and configures the Mobile
    Network accordingly to get the fastest routing.\
    If just the application identifier is used, the Telco Operator Platform
    identifies all the EAS Instances and activates the optimal routing on the
    Mobile Network.\
    If the optimal routing in term of latency should be available just for a set
    of users, the TI API must be invoked for each user creating a new
    TrafficInfluce resource for each one.
    If the Application offers different services on different interfaces a
    traffic filter based on IP, Port and Protocol can be used. I this way it is
    also possible to redirect different users to different interfaces.
    Here are some possible intents:
    1) activate the optimal routing for any EAS instance: the TI API must be
    invoked with the "appId". The Telco Operator Platform identifies all the EAS
    instances and activates the optimal routing on the Mobile Network.
    2) activate the optimal routing in a specific Region or Zone: the TI API
    must be invoked with the "appId" and the Zones and Regions identifiers.
    3) activate the optimal routing for a user devices: the TI API can  be
    invoked with a user Device identifier (“Device”). For each user Device,
    a TI API invocation is required.
    ## Release Notes
    The Traffic Influence API reduces the complexity of the 3GPP Traffic
    Influence API exposed by the 3GPP Network Exposure Function (NEF) [1]. While
    the 3GPP TI API offers fastest routing activation and user mobility among
    different edge sites, this version of the CAMARA Traffic Influence API
    covers only the fastest routing activation, also for selected users.
    User mobility will be introduced in a future version.\
    \
    **Enhancements with respect to the previous release V0.8.1:**
    - These release also effects existing data sessions
    - These release can be also used to optimize  existing data sessions when a
        Device moves among geographical areas.
    - The ueId parameter is renamed into Device
    - The parameter Device, that identifies the User, is now simplified to
        guarantee the identification of an existing data session

    - TrafficFilters description updated
    - CAMEL type adopted
    - FlowInfo deleted
    - OpenAPI version updated to 3.0.3
    - To let the Developer to just work on parameters actually editable, the PUT

        parameters usable and modifiable. A new resource is created,
        PatchTrafficInfluence that contains only the editable parameters
        The same approach is also adopted for the PUT method and a new resource
        PostTrafficInfluence was created with just the editable parameters
    - DELETE response code modified as 202. The Deletion request is accepted
        (not yet completed, it must be carried on by the system)
