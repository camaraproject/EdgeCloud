    # Find the closest Edge Cloud Zone
    ---
    # Summary

    The Simple Edge Discovery API returns the name of the closest operator Edge
    Cloud Zone to a particular user device.

    # Purpose
    Network operators may host multiple Edge Cloud Zones in a
    given territory. Connecting your application to a server on the closest
    Edge Cloud Zone means packets travel the shortest distance between
    endpoints, typically resulting in the lowest round-trip latency. Note, the
    physical (GPS) location of a user device is not a reliable way to determine
    the closest Edge Cloud Zone, due to the way operator networks are routed -
    so the operator will calculate the Edge Cloud Zone with the
    _shortest network path_to the network-attached device identified in the API
    request.

    Once you have the name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to the user device,
    you may:

    * connect the application client on the user device to your application
    server instance on that Edge Cloud Zone. Note: the address of that server
    instance is not part of the API response, but should be known in advance.
    * or, if you have no instance on that Edge Cloud Zone, you may wish to
    deploy one there.

    # Usage

    The API may be called either by an application client hosted on a device
    attached to the operator network (i.e. phone, tablet), or by a server.

    There is a single API endpoint: `/edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest`. To call
    this endpoint, the API consumer must first obtain a valid OAuth2 token from
    the token endpoint, and pass it as an `Authorization` header in the API
    request.

    The API returns the closest Edge Cloud Zone to a given device, so that
    device needs to be identifiable by the network:

    * If you call the API from a server, you must explicitly pass one or
    more device identifiers in the HTTP request header:
      * `IP-Address`. This is the public IP address of the user device: this
      can be obtained by an application hosted on that device calling a
      public IP address API (e.g. GET https://api.ipify.org?format=json)
      * `Phone-Number` . The international E.164 format (starting with country
      code), e.g. +4407123123456
      * `Network-Access-Identifier` (where available from the API host operator)

    * If you call the API from a device attached to the operator network, then
    you can attempt the request without passing device identifier(s) parameters
    in the request header. If that request fails with a `404 Not Found` error
    then retry the request but this time include a device identifier.

    The provider of the Edge Cloud Zone may be an operator, or a cloud provider.

    # Example requests:

    Examples for all API clients:
    ```
      GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/json
      Network-Access-Identifier: 4d596ac1-7822-4927-a3c5-d72e1f922c94@domain.com

      GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/json
      IP-Address: 84.125.93.10

      GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/json
      Phone-Number: +441234567890
    ```
    
    Example where API client is on a network-attached device:

    ```
      GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/json
    ```
    
    # Responses

    ## Success

    A JSON object is returned containing an array with a single member object.
    This contains identifiers for the closest Edge Cloud Zone. The HTTP status
    code will be`200 OK`. An example response:
    
    ```
    [
      {
        "edgeCloudZoneId": "4gt555-6457-7890-d4he-1dc79f44gb66",
        "edgeCloudZoneName": "example zone name",
        "edgeCloudProvider": "example zone provider"
      }
    ]
    ```
    * `edgeCloudZoneId` is a UUID for the Edge Cloud Zone.
    * `edgeCloudZoneName` is the common name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to
    the user device.
    * `edgeCloudProvider` is the name of the operator or cloud provider of
    the Edge Cloud Zone.

    ## Errors

    If the authentication token is not valid, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is
    returned.

    If the mobile subscription parameters contain a formatting error, a `400
    INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

    If the mobile subscription cannot be identified from the provided
    parameters, a `404 NOT_FOUND` error is returned.

    Any more general service failures will result in an error in the `5xx`range
    with an explanation.

    # Notes for Simple Edge Discovery API publishers

    If an `IP-Address` header parameter is provided then the operator should
    assume the request is coming from a developer's server rather than a device
    attached to the network. In which case the developer server is expected to
    have been provided with the device public IP address (e.g. by the
    application client on that device signalling it back to the server).

    If neither the `IP-Address parameter` nor any other device identifier is
    provided in the API request header, then the operator should assume the
    request is from a device attached to their network, and attempt to use the
    public IP source address to determine which packet gateway issued it (and
    hence the closest edge to that gateway).

    If no `IP-Address` header parameter is provided, but another device
    identifier(s) is provided, then the operator should assume the request is
    coming from a device attached to their network and should make use of one
    or both of the public IP source address (from the IP packet header) and the
    device identifier(s) provided in the HTTPS request header.

    # Authorization and authentication

    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API
    clients access to the API functionality, as outlined in the document
    [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md]
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md).
    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during
    onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator
    exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing
    the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework
    dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is
    processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through
    mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens
    becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict
    compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations,
    upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
