## Overview

The reference scenario foresees a distributed Telco Edge Cloud where any Application Delevoper, known as an Application Provider, can host and deploy their application according to their specifications and operational criteria (e.g. within an specific geographical zone for data protection purposes, ensure a minimum QoS for the application clients, etc). Through Telco Edge Cloud services Developers around the globe can be benefit from the traditional Cloud strengths but expertise and advantages of the Mobile Network Operators offering to their users an evolved experience for XR, V2X, Holographic and other new services.

## 1. Introduction
The Edge Cloud LcM API provides capabilities for lifecycle management of application instances and edge discovery.

Lifecycle Management allows Application Provider to onboard their application details to the Operator Platform which do bookkeeping, resource validation and other pre-deployment operations. Application details can contain components network specification , package type (QCOW2, OVA, CONTAINER, HELM), operating system details and respository to download the image of the desired application.

Once the application is available on the Operator Platform, the Application Provider can instantiate the application. OP helps AP to decide where to instantiate the applications allowing them to retrieve a list of Edge Zones that meets the provided criteria. This discovery can be filtered by an specific geographical region (e.g when data residency is need) and by status (active, inactive, unknown).

Application Provider can ask the operator to instantiate the application to one or several Edge Zones that meet the criteria. Typically when more than one Edge Zone is required in the same geographic boundary, AP can define instead the entire Region. AP can retrieve the information of the instances for a given application, the information could be the Edge Zone where the instance is, status (ready, instantiating, failed, terminating, unknown) and endpoint (ip, port, fqdn).

Application Provider can terminate an instance of an application (appInstanceId) or all the instances for a given appId.

## 2. Quick Start

The usage of the Edge Cloud LcM is based on several resources including GSMA Operator Platform, Public Cloud and SDOs, to define a first approach on the lifecycle management of application instances and edge discovery.

Before starting to use the API, the developer needs to know about the below specified details.

Two operations have been defined in Edge Cloud LcM API.

**Application** - The Application Provider submit application metadata to the Operator Platform. The OP generate an appId for that metadata that will be used to instantiate the application within the Edge Cloud Zone.

**Edge Cloud** - Retrieves all the Edge Cloud Zones available according to some defined parameters where an application can be instantiated.


# Introduction
    
**Application**
The Application Provider submit application metadata to the Operator Platform.

**Application Instance**
An Operator Platform instantiate an Application on an Edge Cloud Node when the Application Provider resquest it.

**Edge Cloud information**
Retrieves all the Edge nodes available according to some defined parameters.

# Relevant terms and definitions
This section provides definitions of terminologies commonly referred to throughout the API descriptions.

**Application Provider**
The provider of the application that accesses an OP to deploy its application on the Edge Cloud. An Application Provider may be part of a larger organisation, like an enterprise, enterprise customer of an OP, or be an independent entity.

**Application**
Contains the information about the application to be instantiated. Descriptor, binary image, charts or any other package assosiated with the application. The Application Provider request contains mandatory criteria (e.g. required CPU, memory,storage, bandwidth) defined in an Application.

**Edge Cloud**
Cloud-like capabilities located at the network edge including, from the Application Provider's perspective, access to elastically allocated compute, data storage and network resources.

**Edge Cloud Zone**
An Edge Cloud Zone is the lowest level of abstraction exposed to an Application Provider who wants to deploy an Application on Edge Cloud. Zones exist within a Region.


**OP**
Operator Platform. An Operator Platform (facilitates access to the Edge Cloud and other capabilities of an Operator or federation of Operators and Partners. ^[1]

**Region**
An OP Region is equivalent to a Region on a public cloud. The higher construct in the hierarchy exposed to an Application Provider who wishes to deploy an Application on the Edge Cloud and broadly represents a geography. A Region typically contains one or multiple Zones. A Region exists within an Edge Cloud.

### Application Management

**submitApp**
Submits an application details to an OP. Based on the details provided,  OP shall do bookkeeping, resource validation and other pre-deployment operations.

**deleteApp**
Removes an application from an OP, if there is a running instance of the given application, the request cannot be done.

**getApp**
Retrieves the information of a given application.

### Application Instance Management

**appInstantiation**
Request the OP to instatiate an instance of an application in a given Edge Cloud Zone, if this parameter is not set, the OP will instantiate the applications in all the Edge Cloud Zones available.

**getAppInstance**
Retrieves the list with information of the instances related to a given application.

**deleteAppInstance**
Removes a given application instance from an Edge Cloud Zone.

### Edge Cloud information

**getEdgeCloudZones**
List of the operatorâ€™s Edge Cloud Zones and their status, ordering the results by location and filtering by status (active/inactive/unknown).
