**Edge Selection and Application Lifecycle Working Group Project Charter**

**Introduction**

The Edge Selection and Application Lifecycle Working Group ("ESALG") is a subgroup within the Edge Cloud Working Group, operating under the CAMARA Project. 'Edge Cloud' here refers to cloud resources (compute, storage, networking etc.) hosted at a telco operator 'Edge' â€“ meaning within the operator's own domain and not on the public Internet. Any devices (smartphones, tablets, sensors etc.) connected to that operator's network will benefit from reduced application latency, because the network communication path from client to edge-hosted server is significantly reduced compared to the public Internet. The Working Group focuses on the development of APIs for edge selection and edge application lifecycle, while considering contributions from 5GFF, Capgemini, and EdgeXR and potentially additional contributions from other group members. The primary goal of this subgroup is to align on the basic model and architecture of edge selection and edge application lifecycle, defining the semantics of edge selection and ,scope and structure of north-bound APIs.

**Scope**

- The Edge Selection Working Group will focus on developing APIs specifically for edge selection and edge application lifecycle, taking into account existing contributions from 5GFF, Capgemini, and EdgeXR and additional contributions from group members.
- The Working Group will align on the basic model and architecture of edge selection and edge application lifecycle, defining what is meant by edge selectionthe functional scope and who can or should call these APIs.
- As per the CAMARA project charter, the functional scope of the Working Group is limited to telco APIs, which includes APIs in the domain of telco mobile networks or telco fixed-line networks [[Technical Charter of the CAMARA Project](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/ProjectCharter.md#scope-of-the-project)].

**Non-goals**

- The Working Group will not focus on generic enterprise APIs, as the scope is limited to telco APIs in accordance with the Technical Charter of the CAMARA Project.
- Developing or proposing APIs that do not align with the overall CAMARA project's objectives, scope, and design principles.
- APIs that are not designed to be used by application developers, i.e. southbound APIs of an edge system towards the infrastructure or east-west-bound APIs to federate with other edge systems.

**Deliverables**

- Edge selection and edge application lifecycle APIs that align with the CAMARA Project's principles and objectives.
- Comprehensive documentation for the developed edge selection APIs.
- Test plans, cases, and tools for validating the functionality and performance of the proposed edge selection APIs.
- Recommendations and guidelines for API version alignment, implementation choices
- Optionally reference implementations of the aligned APIs

**Governance**

The Edge Selection and Application Lifecycle Working Group will follow the governance structure and principles outlined in the CAMARA Project's technical charter. This includes adhering to the project's principles of being open, welcoming and respectful, transparent and accessible, and merit-based. The Working Group will work under the guidance and direction of the Steering Committee and collaborate with other Working Groups, Sub Projects, and its parent group, the Edge Cloud Working Group, as necessary.

**Timeline and Milestones**

The timeline and milestones for the Edge Selection and Application Lifecycle Working Group will be defined by the Steering Committee in collaboration with the Working Group participants. The Working Group will provide regular updates on its progress and deliverables to the Steering Committee and other relevant stakeholders.

**Amendments**

This charter may be amended by the Steering Committee following consultation with the Edge Selection and Application Lifecycle Working Group participants. Any proposed changes will be communicated to all Project participants and discussed in an open and transparent manner.
