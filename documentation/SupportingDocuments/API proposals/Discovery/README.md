# Edge Discovery APIs

## Simple Discovery API

This API allows a client application to discover the closest MEC platform to the UE hosting the client application. 'Closest' means 'shortest network path' as that will give the shortest propagation distance, which is a major factor in latency.

## MEC Experience Management and Exposure API

This API allows a developer to:

- discover available MEC platforms, ranked by proximity to a UE.
- read the state (availability and capabilities) of an operator's various MEC platforms.
- register a service profile (a description of the developer's edge service) with the MEC operator.
- register the deployed service endpoints with the MEC operator, which allows the closest service endpoint to be discovered at runtime.

The API will also support the following capabilities:

- events(such as change of status of a MEC platform or another event which could affect their service).
- subscription to notification of events.

## Mapping to the list of intents

These APIs fulfil the ['discovery' intents](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/blob/main/documentation/SupportingDocuments/Harmonisation%20of%20APIs/describing%20and%20harmonising%20the%20Edge%20APIs.md)

*Simple Edge Discovery* fulfils a single intent, "4. I can discover the closest MEC platform to a specific terminal (closest in terms of shortest network path)"

*MEC Exposure and Experience Management* is a more comprehensive discovery API and fulfils the following intents:

### Developer intents

#### Provisioning intents

1. "I can retrieve a list of the operator’s MECs and their status, ordering the results by location and filtering by status (active/inactive/unknown)"
2. "I can discover the capabilities/resources available at an operator’s MEC: CPU, Memory, Storage, GPU"
3. "I can discover the geographical regions covered by the operators MECs"
4. "I can discover the closest MEC platform to a specific terminal (closest in terms of shortest network path)"

16. "I can ask the operator to provide the details of all the on-boarded applications"
17. "I can ask the operator to inform about the application instance details e.g., communication endpoints, resource consumed etc"

#### Runtime intents

19. "I can discover the closest MEC platform to a particular terminal (closest in terms of shortest network path)"
20. "I can discover the optimal MEC platform for my application and a particular terminal, taking into account connectivity, shortest network path, cost, network load etc." (`A`)
21. "I can discover the optimal application service endpoint for a specific terminal, taking into account mobility events, connectivity, shortest network path, cost, network load, MEC platform load etc."

### Operator intents

#### Provisioning intents

23. "I can publish an (ordered, filtered) list of my MECs, their coverage, capabilities and status" *(aligns with 1,2,3 in the developer intents)*
24. "I can map an application’s requirements to the best MEC for hosting it, based on application demands for CPU, Memory, Storage, GPU, bandwidth, Network forecast, mobility" *(aligns with 4,5,8,9)*

#### Runtime intents

25. "I can inform the developer of any event which changes which MEC is optimal for their application and connected terminals" *(aligns with 6)*

## Notes

`A` this may not be the closest MEC, rather the 'best MEC for this job' which accounts for current MEC or network load, MEC compute power and features etc.
