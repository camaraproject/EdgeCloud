| Edge Cloud API family | EdgeXR | Analysis of the different contributions to the API (5GFF, OPAG, EdgeX<br>R, New DT contribution). This activity is assigned to a new group in order to analyze all the contributions, define which APIs we must have in this Edge Cloud family, analyze the different APIs to align them with the proposal.<br>In the last session, the EdgeXR team was established as responsible for organizing this small group and starting the activities.<br>Thomas presented the next steps: Have a Kick-off meeting to start working on the activities. A link is attached for those who want to participate and indicate the best option according to availability: ([https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/dBLrAQna](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/dBLrAQna)).<br>It is necessary to include in the analyzes of this group the pull request about the questions, doubts and comments of each proposal. For this, it is proposed as the first point on the agenda of the first session to resolve all doubts and questions. |
| ***Comment - Pull Request  #24*** | All | #24 - UNI API: There are different options for this API: Should this API be included in CAMERA? Should 3GPP be used to define this UNI API? Should a part of the API be defined in CAMERA and a part in 3GPP? It is proposed to start a small group to discuss this topic, align and share status in these bi-weekly sessions. It is important to fix this issue, whether or not UNI API is part of the Edge Cloud group, as soon as possible.<br>Deepak (Capgemini) is goin to arrange a short group that is going to have as objetive aligne possiions in this isue |

This group will decide if it is better to create a new group in CAMARA specifically for Traffic Influence or if this functionality is part of one of the currently available groups. |
