| Item | Who | Description |
| ---- | --- | ----------- |
| EdgeXR API proposal | EdgeXR | EdgeXR generated 2 API pull requests for thisgroup: *App APIs* [#26](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/26) and  *App session and Discovery APIs* [#27](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/27). Jon Gainsley made a general overview of each one. During the session, the possibility of sharing the call flow or sequence diagram of the APIs was requested. EdgeXR will fetch this information and share it. |
| Comment - Pull Request [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/21)</span> | 5GFF | [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/26) - Create EdgeCloudApi\_v0.0.5. yaml: Added a list of API questions today in the pull request. An additional specific session is proposed to discuss the points and questions. It was asked who would be interested in participating, the invitation will be sent to all participants. |
| Comment - Pull Request [#24](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/24) | 5GFF | [#24 - UNI API](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/26): Comments from 5GFF about removing or not the UNI API in this CAMERA group. Mahesh gives first feedback indicating that it will not be very easy for non-Telco users to use the API. This argument is complemented with additional points in the pull request. On the part of Telefonica, it is internally evaluating to have an answer as soon as possible. If necessary, a specific session can be established to discuss this point. Kevin explained that the term 'UNI' is specifically defined in public GSMA materials as requiring a client SDK/middleware ('User Client') on the client UE; and that 5GFF does not require that User Client. 5GFF API allows an application in the UE to call HTTP(S) operator-hosted APIs directly without requiring any additional SDK to be on the UE.  |
| Draft Proposal for contributions and approval process in WG - Pull request by DT - [#20](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/pull/26) | DT | It is proposed to work with different subbranches. During the last two weeks, no comments have been received on what was proposed by DT, so it is assumed that all the members of this group agree with this proposal. The next step will be to move the 5GFF contribution to a sub-branch and work on different branches in order to push the proposal to the master branch for approval. In parallel, the way to work to validate the 3 current proposals (MEC Contribution, 5GFF Contribution and EdgeXR Contribution) will be having technical meetings to discuss each point and have the final decision. EdgeXR is interested in managing and organizing these activities. The proposal is that Thomas Vits prepare and elaborate a first proposal for the next technical meeting during the next 2 weeks and have a status in the next bi-weekly session. Different technical activities will be worked on in parallel. |
| Next steps | EdgeXR & TEF | Telefonica and EdgeXR will discuss the next steps to follow will be discussed, beginning with the analysis with the superposition of each proposal and, as a second step, defining the Action Points to have the Edge Cloud API family with all the required functionalities, the discussion of adding or not the UNI API to the Edge Cloud API family |
