# CAMARA - Edge Cloud Group

May 2022

## Edge Cloud API

Telefónica & Capgemini propose a new working group in CAMARA to create the Edge Cloud API. The reference API will be the Edge Cloud API defined in the OPAG – Group A
This Edge Cloud API, is not a traditional hosting service. Some of its new features are:
* Federation concept defined in the Operator Platform (GSMA)
* Discover adequate edge cloud in the current location of the end users (this discovery is in function of theQoS that need the App)
* Application mobility strategy that includes QoE, geographical store and privacy policies intent
* ...
* Edge cloud is not a traditional hosting service but rather an optimal hosting service suited to the connectivity
characteristics of the client/user – latency is taken into account to choose the “optimal” node.
* Edge Cloud Group is created in GitHub
   GitHub - camaraproject/EdgeCloud: Repository to describe, develop, document and test the EdgeCloud API family
* Repository to describe, develop, document and test the Edge Cloud API family
* Scope:
 * Service APIs for “Edge Cloud” (see APIBacklog.md)
 * It provides the customer with the ability to:
  * Provide and manage application images to be deployed on resources within the operator network
  * Use reserved compute resources within the operator network for the deployment of applications on VMs or containers
  * NOTE: The scope of this API family should be limited (at least at a first stage) to 4G and 5G.
* Describe, develop, document and test the APIs (with 1-2 Telcos)
* Started: April 2022
* Location: virtually
